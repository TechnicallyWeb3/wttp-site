# Understanding WTTP Smart Contracts

*How the magic happens: Breaking down WTTP's three-layer architecture*

## The Big Picture

WTTP uses a **three-layer architecture** where each layer handles a specific job. Think of it like a restaurant:

- **Permissions Layer**: The bouncer (who gets in?)
- **Storage Layer**: The kitchen (where's the food stored?)
- **Site Layer**: The waiter (how do customers interact?)

## Layer 1: BaseWTTPPermissions - "The Bouncer"

### What it does
Controls **who can do what** on your WTTP site.

### Real-world analogy
Like a bouncer at a club who checks IDs and decides who can enter, who can access VIP areas, and who gets kicked out.

### Key concepts

#### Roles (Who People Are)
```javascript
// Built-in roles:
DEFAULT_ADMIN    // Site owner - can do anything
SITE_ADMIN       // Site manager - can manage most things  
PUBLIC_ROLE      // Everyone - basic access
BLACKLIST_ROLE   // Banned users - explicitly denied access

// Custom roles (you create these):
EDITOR_ROLE      // Can edit content
VIEWER_ROLE      // Can only read content
```

#### How it works
```solidity
// Check if someone can do something:
if (hasRole(EDITOR_ROLE, userAddress)) {
    // User can edit content
} else {
    // Access denied
}
```

### Why this matters for you
- **Fine-grained control**: Give different people different permissions
- **Safety first**: DEFAULT_ADMIN can always fix broken configurations
- **Flexible**: Create custom roles for your specific needs

## Layer 2: BaseWTTPStorage - "The Kitchen"

### What it does
Manages **where your content lives** and how it's organized.

### Real-world analogy
Like a restaurant kitchen with organized storage areas, inventory management, and a system for tracking what's where.

### Key concepts

#### Content Chunking
```
Large file (100KB) ‚Üí Split into chunks (32KB each)
                  ‚Üì
[Chunk 1: 32KB] [Chunk 2: 32KB] [Chunk 3: 32KB] [Chunk 4: 4KB]
```

#### ESP Integration (Economic Storage Protocol)
```javascript
// When you store new content:
1. Content gets hashed (unique fingerprint)
2. If content already exists ‚Üí you pay royalty to original publisher
3. If content is new ‚Üí you become the publisher
4. Others who store same content later ‚Üí pay you royalty
```

#### Metadata Management
Every piece of content has metadata:
```javascript
{
  size: "98304 bytes",           // How big is it?
  version: 3,                    // What version number?
  lastModified: "2024-01-15",    // When was it updated?
  mimeType: "text/html",         // What type of file?
  chunks: ["0x123...", "0x456..."] // Where are the pieces?
}
```

### Why this matters for you
- **Efficient storage**: Big files are broken into manageable pieces
- **Cost optimization**: Reusing content saves money for everyone
- **Versioning**: Keep track of changes over time
- **Economic incentives**: Earn money from content others reuse

## Layer 3: BaseWTTPSite - "The Waiter"

### What it does
Provides **HTTP-like methods** for interacting with your content.

### Real-world analogy
Like a waiter who takes your order, brings your food, and handles special requests - the interface between you and the kitchen.

### HTTP Methods (What You Can Do)

#### GET - Retrieve Content
```javascript
// Just like a regular web request:
const response = await site.GET({
  path: "/index.html"
});
// Returns: content data and metadata
```

#### PUT - Create/Replace Content
```javascript
// Upload new content:
await site.PUT({
  path: "/index.html",
  data: htmlContent,
  properties: { mimeType: "text/html" }
});
```

#### PATCH - Update Part of Content
```javascript
// Update specific chunks (useful for large files):
await site.PATCH({
  path: "/large-video.mp4",
  data: newChunkData,
  chunkIndex: 5  // Update the 6th chunk
});
```

#### DELETE - Remove Content
```javascript
// Remove content:
await site.DELETE({
  path: "/old-page.html"
});
```

#### HEAD - Get Metadata Only
```javascript
// Check if file exists and get info without downloading:
const metadata = await site.HEAD({
  path: "/index.html"
});
```

#### OPTIONS - Check Permissions
```javascript
// See what methods are allowed:
const allowed = await site.OPTIONS({
  path: "/admin-panel.html"
});
// Returns: which HTTP methods this user can use
```

#### DEFINE - Set Headers/Permissions
```javascript
// Configure how content behaves:
await site.DEFINE({
  path: "/api/data.json",
  headers: {
    cache: { maxAge: 3600 },
    cors: { allowOrigin: "*" },
    permissions: { readRole: PUBLIC_ROLE }
  }
});
```

### Status Codes (Just Like HTTP)
```javascript
200 // OK - everything worked
201 // Created - new content added
204 // No Content - empty response
304 // Not Modified - cached version is current
403 // Forbidden - no permission
404 // Not Found - content doesn't exist
405 // Method Not Allowed - can't use this HTTP method
```

## How the Layers Work Together

### Example: Uploading a Website

```javascript
// 1. Permissions layer checks: "Can this user upload?"
if (!hasRole(EDITOR_ROLE, userAddress)) {
  throw new Error("403 Forbidden");
}

// 2. Storage layer handles: "Where should this go?"
const chunks = splitIntoChunks(websiteFiles);
const dataPoints = await storeChunks(chunks);

// 3. Site layer responds: "Upload complete!"
return {
  status: 201,
  message: "Website uploaded successfully",
  dataPoints: dataPoints
};
```

### Example: Viewing a Website

```javascript
// 1. Site layer receives: GET /index.html
// 2. Permissions layer checks: "Can this user read?"
// 3. Storage layer fetches: content chunks
// 4. Site layer returns: assembled content
```

## Inheritance Chain

```
BaseWTTPPermissions (access control)
        ‚Üì extends
BaseWTTPStorage (content management)  
        ‚Üì extends
BaseWTTPSite (HTTP interface)
        ‚Üì implements
Your Custom Site (your specific features)
```

Each layer builds on the previous one, adding more functionality.

## Benefits of This Architecture

### For Developers
- **Familiar patterns**: HTTP methods you already know
- **Modular design**: Override only what you need
- **Clear separation**: Permissions ‚â† Storage ‚â† Interface

### For Users
- **Predictable behavior**: Works like web APIs
- **Secure by default**: Multiple layers of protection
- **Flexible permissions**: Fine-grained access control

### For the Ecosystem
- **Reusable components**: Build on proven foundations
- **Economic efficiency**: Shared storage reduces costs
- **Interoperability**: Standard interfaces across sites
